- Hi, I am Sharang Kaul. A perseverant PhD researcher interested to explore areas of Artificial intelligence, where software  intelligence and hardware computation goes together.
I am currently performing research on improving long-term visual localization for automated driving using deep-visual SLAM front-ends for tasks of place recognition and feature matching. 
- I am enthusiatic about solving challenges in deep learning, SLAM, and computer vision. I am currently pursuing my PhD research on 'Quantifying the performance of perception for automated driving' from Cariad SE and Robot Learning Lab at Albert-Ludwigs-Universität-Freiburg. 
- I am looking to collaborate on topics related to image retreival, localization and mapping, object detection and multi-object tracking, etc. and you can reach me at sharang.kaul1603@gmail.com or https://www.linkedin.com/in/sharangkaul/
